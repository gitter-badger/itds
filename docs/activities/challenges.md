# 30% | Coding challenges


**:fontawesome-solid-chess: Coding Challenges** are small puzzles that are shared by the instructor.

Learning data science requires you to continuously practice what you learn. There are a lot of new bits of information that you will acquire during every class meeting. The aim of these coding challenges is to provide students with new opportunities to apply what you learn during the weekly meetings in new but similar contexts. There will be some time during the class meetings to start working on these challenges, and to address any question, but most of it will be completed after class.

- **:fontawesome-solid-exclamation-triangle: Each of the coding challenges are due before the beginning of the next class meeting.**

## The Challenge Workflow
1. The challenge is shared with the students at least 5 days before the next session.
2. You accept the challenge by clicking the challenge icon :fontawesome-solid-chess: in the [Schedule](../schedule.md) page.
    - :fontawesome-brands-github: GitHub creates and provides you with a link to your challenge repository and a challenge file.
3. You can start working on the challenge and making submissions.
    - You submit your work directly on :fontawesome-brands-github: GitHub.
    - Submission are considered until the start of the next session.
    - Late submissions will not be considered!

When you are stuck during a coding challenge, try to solve your bugs (e.g. Google your error messages). Trying to solve your errors and bugs will help you build the mindset needed to be successful in this course and will help you better understand the tools we use throughout the course.

- If you are stuck for too long (>30mins) during a challenge, take a break and revisit try again later.
- If you are still stuck after revisiting your problem with a fresh mindset ask for help using the communication platform! Don't be shy, it is very likely that other students might be able to help you!

## Grading
Challenges will be graded based on the best five out of six individual grades.
Grades follow a 4-category scale:

| Icon | Description                                     |
| :-:  | -                                               |
| ✓+   | Exceptional, above and beyond what was expected |
| ✓    | Completed with good effort                      |
| ✓-   | Acceptable, but major deficiencies              |
| ∅    | Unacceptable; did not submit                    |
