# 30% | Participation

The participation grade is divided into three parts: Live demos, class involvement, and online involvement.

**:fontawesome-solid-chalkboard-teacher: Live demos:** Students are expected to do a live demo that helps the class understand a topic during a session. A demo is an hands-on demonstration that introduces a programming, or statistical applied to social science theories and illustrates how to use it through an example. The live demo lasts no longer than 15 minutes.

- [**:fontawesome-solid-file-code: Demo Handout**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mickaeltemporao/methodes-sciences-sociales-materials/blob/main/rapport-de-lecture.ipynb): The Demo handout needs to be shared with the group before the class meeting on :fontawesome-brands-slack: Slack.

**:fontawesome-solid-comments: Class Involvmeent**: Students are expected to be active during the class meetings and actively participating and engaging in the ongoing class activites.

**:fontawesome-regular-comments: Online Involvement:** Students are also expected to be active on the communication platform, that is by asking questions or by helping their peers when they have questions. For more details see the [Communication](#Communication) guidelines below.
