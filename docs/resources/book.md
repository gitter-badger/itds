# Books

All the materials required are free and will shared with the students. For those who would like to add more colour to the concepts introduced in this course here are some indicative readings that can be useful but not required for the course. Some of those books are also free and accessible online.

- King, G., Keohane, R. O., & Verba, S. (1994). *Designing social inquiry*. Princeton university press.
