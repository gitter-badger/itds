What are the factors influencing vote choice? How can we predict election outcomes? These are just a few of the numerous questions that social scientists are tackling using data science. Beyond academia, companies and non-profits have invested heavily in data science techniques to learn about their users, platforms, and programs. Data scientists at these institutions are essentially applied social scientists and employ many of the same techniques you will learn in this course. What you will learn in this course? This course introduces students to the building blocks of data science and machine learning with real world data and applications in political science, sociology or economics. The ability to collect and analyze data in a sophisticated manner is now a crucial skill set for the modern job market across industries. Learning such methods and tools requires practice. This course follows a \u201clearn-by-doing\u201d approach and will place emphasis on gaining experience by analyzing real-world data and solving problems using cutting edge yet free open source software. It will allow you to apply your theoretical knowledge and articulate the methods learned in an end to end research project throughout the course. The course is designed for social science students that are not necessarily familiar with quantitative methods or computer programming. Learning support will be provided for at least one programming language, such as C++ , Julia , Python , or R , but the choice of language supported may vary between years, depending on judged benefits to students, whether in terms of pedagogy or resulting skills. This year, the default choice is Python . Goals \u00b6 Visualize, summarise, and analyse real-world data using reproducible code based on cutting-edge open source tools for data analysis. Understand the scientific method, critically evaluate existing information, and leverage such methods in a fully reproducible end to end scientific project. Develop an ethical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of machine learning and artificial intelligence from a social scientist perspective. Requirements \u00b6 The most important requirement is motivation to work hard on likely unfamiliar material. The second most important requirement is to have access to a computer in order to participate and complete the various activities. From there, we will learn as we go! In order to fight against digital inequalities among students, Sciences Po Bordeaux sets up a support system under certain conditions (presentation of a purchase invoice; N-1 tax notice of your reference tax household ; notification of CROUS scholarship; certificate of attendance for the current year). For any questions relating to this device and in order to submit your request, please write only to the following address, specifying your needs: Aides Num\u00e9riques Structure \u00b6 This course has 24 class meetings that span over two semester of 12 classes each. During the class meetings students have the opportunity to accomplish various activities. The activities allow students to incrementally assimilate critical concepts that will lead them to deliver a fully reproducible end to end scientific project. Class Meetings \u00b6 Live class meetings are held once per week and provide students with many opportunities to perform in-class activities related to the material in that week. Each session is divided into three parts: a live demo, the theoretical discussion, and hack-time which demonstrate how to leverage these concepts programmatically. The demo is lead by a student. A student is expected to do a 15 minutes presentation. This demo is a hands-on demonstration that introduces and applies a programming concept related to the session and illustrates how to use it through an example within the social sciences. The theoretical discussion is lead by the instructor. The instructor will usually walk through real world examples that supplement the demo to illustrate how to leverage data science in the real world. The students are expected to follow along with their computers. The hack-time is where we learn and apply new tools and methods together. The instructor will provide code and data that illustrate the application of data science to political science, sociology or economics. This part is often followed by a \"challenge\" where students will need to apply what they have learned to new data. Grading \u00b6 The course is evaluated over two semesters through various activities allowing students to incrementally improve data science skills. By the end of the course, students will deliver an end to end empirical research project that is fully reproducible and that leverages the acquired data science skills. Activities Percentage Participation 30% Challenges 30% Project 40% Communication \u00b6 This course has a dedicated communication platform Slack. When you have questions outside course meetings, click the Communication tab at the top of this page and ask your question in a public channel. Asking questions publicly and providing answers to your peers' questions allows everyone to learn dynamically. Furthermore, if you have a question on a topic, it is likely that someone else has the same question. Finally, being active on the platform, whether by answering the questions of your peers or by asking questions, is strongly encouraged and will have a positive impact on your participation grade!

Learning data science requires you to continuously practice what you learn. There are a lot of new bits of information that you will acquire during every class meeting. The aim of these coding challenges is to provide students with new opportunities to apply what you learn during the weekly meetings in new but similar contexts. There will be some time during the class meetings to start working on these challenges, and to address any question, but most of it will be completed after class. The coding challenges are ALWAYS due before the beginning of the next class meeting. The Challenge Workflow \u00b6 Each challenge is shared with the students at least 5 days before the next session. You start by opening the coding challenge by clicking the challenge icon in Schedule page. When you are inside the notebook click on \"File\" -> \"Save a copy in Drive\" A new notebook is created named \"Copy of ...\". Don't skip this step otherwise you won't be able to save or submit your work! Rename the notebook called \"Copy of ...\" appropriately. This is the notebook for your assignment. You can start working inside the newly generated and renamed notebook Once you are ready to submit your work click the \"Share\" button then on the \"Copy link\" button. Verify that your link works by opening it in a new browser window. You should see your latest edits inside the this notebook. Send the instructor a direct message on In your message include the course name (itds), assignment type (eg. chall-1), and the copied link to your notebook. Submission are considered until the start of the next session. Late submissions will not be considered! When you are stuck during a coding challenge, try to solve your bugs (e.g. Google your error messages). Trying to solve your errors and bugs will help you build the mindset needed to be successful in this course and will help you better understand the tools we use throughout the course. If you are stuck for too long (>30mins) during a challenge, take a break and revisit try again later. If you are still stuck after revisiting your problem with a fresh mindset ask for help using the communication platform! Don't be shy, it is very likely that other students might be able to help you!

Your project will prepare the data, visualize and introduce a model. You will discuss the challenges related to the data you are using, carry out a motivated and valid model implementation, and assess the strengths and weaknesses of your data and model(s). Context \u00b6 You are a young data scientist, with a strong social science background working for the New York Times during the 2020 United States Presidential campaign. You are tasked to understand voting behaviour using the ANES 2020 dataset. You are expected to suggest a motivated machine learning model explaining the democratic vote (V201033) using the ANES 2020 dataset. The project can use any of the methods introduced during the course, but is not limited to. You will explain the methods and the variables you choose to incorporate in your model and why those are appropriate to predicting your target. You can use theory or data to motivate your choices. You will also discuss the assumptions made by the methods, the data and the limits of what we can learn from your model. Objective \u00b6 Leverage theory and data to critically build and evaluate a predictive model. Articulate prose and code to answer a research question. Develop an end-to-end reproducible project. Instructions \u00b6 Your submission will consist of a notebook (.ipynb) that is shared with the instructor. The template will be automatically created for you when you accept the assignment.
